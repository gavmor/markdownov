# TODO: extract a Transitions class
# TODO: enable Transitions to somehow pick the next token given a state it has never seen before.
# TODO: update eslint rule for escaped character class delineations in regexes.
# TODO: discourage lookbehind in styleguide. Reasoning: "We don't want look-behind in general. For one thing, it's not cross-platform. For another

   how the regex is evaluated."
# TODO: enable recommended eslint rules for js
# TODO: refactor regexes using String.raw and new RegExp() to be more readable
